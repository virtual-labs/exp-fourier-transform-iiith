The experiment is design to understand and learn the Fourier transform concepts. This experiment consists two parts:

1. Forward Fourier Transform

2. Importance of Phase

Steps to run experiment:

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select image' option

   a.  Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

2. Select one option from 'Forward Fourier Transform' and 'Importance of phase'

   a. For 'Forward Fourier Transform' 

      i. Press 'Run'.

   2. For 'Importance of phase'

      a. Select one option

         i. Choice 1

         ii. Choice 2

         iii. Choice 3

         iv. Choice 4

         v. Choice 5

         vi. Choice 6

3. Press 'Run'.

4. Output result will be displayed in the output panel.

**Interesting Observations:**

1. Try 'advanced' option with different combinations of parameters and compare the results.
